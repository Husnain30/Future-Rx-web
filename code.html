            <p class="para1">Odds are, if you are reading this, you already know the problem: For years payors have been
                bending to the will of big Pharmacy Benefit Managers, simply because we had no other choice. As a
                result, the pharmacy benefit has become overly complex, costly and opaque to payors and members alike.
                With “the Big Guys” in control of our PBMs, we have been forced to “partner” with our biggest
                competitors, while they maintain the data and equity value of our members.

    <section class="section2">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="cap2">Until now, weve continued to procure and delegate this aspect of our business to entities
                who are not
                looking out for our best interests.</h2>
            <p class="para2">
                By continuing this relationship with traditional PBMs, we risk smaller margins, compliance issues, and
                loss of true transparency — not to mention the forfeiture of our data and equity value. This is an
                incredibly dangerous combination, because while we can offer pharmacy benefits, we dont have full
                ownership, accountability and control. Finally, there is a viable solution.</p>

            <p class="para3">Managing a PBM can be an arduous journey fraught with pitfalls and risks at every turn. The
                idea that you can manage your own PBM may seem daunting, or maybe impossible. So most of us choose to
                accept the status quo and end up settling for one-size-fits-all packages leaving efficiency, and more
                importantly equity, on the table.</p>
